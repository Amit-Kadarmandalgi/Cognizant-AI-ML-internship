# Inventory stock percentage predictive and prescriptive analytics using ML in Python
Developed a Inventory Stock percentage prediction using random forest regression model on python.

COGNIZANT AI ML VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP 

Worked on stock percentage prediction for super market data set involving:

•	Exploratory Data Analysis - identifying target variable stock percentage and independent variables such as cost, timestamp, temperature, product category <br>
•	Data Modeling - created a common table using pandas library in python using merge function based on common product id <br>
•	Model Building and Interpretation - built a random forest regression model to train and identify most contributing factor for stock percentage <br>
•	Machine Learning Production - derived mean absolute error for rating model accuracy <br>
•	Quality Assurance - built a deployable python model that just takes in csv as input and gives ML output <br>
